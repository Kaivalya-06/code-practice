            About Exception Handling
        </h2>

        Exception handling is a crucial mechanism in programming that allows developers to gracefully manage runtime errors, or "exceptions," that can disrupt the normal flow of a program's execution. Instead of a program crashing abruptly when an unexpected issue arises (like trying to divide by zero, accessing a file that doesn't exist, or encountering network problems), exception handling provides a structured way to detect, handle, and potentially recover from these errors. This typically involves using try-catch blocks. Code that might raise an exception is placed within the try block. If an exception occurs, the normal execution of the try block is halted, and control is transferred to the catch block, which contains code designed to handle that specific type of exception. This might involve logging the error, displaying a user-friendly message, attempting a recovery action, or cleaning up resources. By implementing effective exception handling, developers can create more robust and user-friendly applications that can gracefully respond to unforeseen circumstances, preventing program termination and providing a better overall experience.
