        <h2>About use of Interface </h2>
        Interfaces in programming serve as powerful contracts that define a set of methods a class must implement. They establish a blueprint of behavior, decoupling the "what" (the methods defined in the interface) from the "how" (the specific implementation within a class). This separation fosters flexibility and maintainability. For instance, imagine an Movable interface with methods like moveForward() and moveBackward(). Different classes, such as Car, Robot, and Drone, can all implement this Movable interface, each providing its unique way of moving. This allows you to write code that interacts with any Movable object without needing to know its specific type, promoting code reusability and making systems easier to extend with new types of movable objects. By adhering to interfaces, developers can build more robust, adaptable, and loosely coupled software systems.
