        <h2>About Instance of Operator</h2>
        Operators are fundamental building blocks in programming languages, acting as symbols that instruct the computer to perform specific operations on one or more values, known as operands. These operations can range from basic arithmetic calculations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) to more complex 1  tasks such as comparing values (e.g., greater than >, less than <), assigning values to variables (=), and manipulating logical states (e.g., AND, OR, NOT). By applying operators, programmers can create expressions that evaluate to new values, control the flow of execution in their programs through conditional and looping constructs, and ultimately manipulate data to achieve desired outcomes. The correct and efficient use of operators is crucial for writing effective and logical code that can solve a wide array of computational problems.
