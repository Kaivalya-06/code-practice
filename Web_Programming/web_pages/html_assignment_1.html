        <h2>
            ...This Paragraph is About Stack...
        </h2>
        <br>
        A stack is a <b>fundamental and Linear data structure</b> in computer science that operates on the <i>Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle</i>, akin to a stack of plates where the last plate placed on top is the first one to be removed. It supports two primary operations: push, which adds an element to the top of the stack, and pop, which removes and returns the topmost element. Additionally, a peek or top operation allows inspection of the top element without removing it, and an isEmpty operation checks if the stack contains any elements.
        Stacks find widespread applications in various computing tasks. They are essential for managing function calls in program execution, keeping track of return addresses, and handling local variables. Compilers utilize stacks for parsing expressions and translating code. In web browsers, the back button functionality often relies on a stack to store the history of visited pages. Undo/redo features in many applications are also implemented using stacks. Their inherent simplicity and efficiency for LIFO operations make them a valuable tool in algorithm design and system implementation. The constrained access (only from the top) ensures a predictable and organized way of managing data in specific scenarios.

        <h2>...This Paragraph Is About Linked List...</h2>
        <br>
        A linked list is a <b>linear data structure</b> where <i>elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element, called a node, contains the data itself and a pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence</i>. This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position, as it only requires updating the pointers of the neighboring nodes, unlike arrays where shifting elements can be time-consuming. <q>Linked lists can be singly linked (pointing only to the next node) or doubly linked (where each node also points to the previous node), offering flexibility in traversal</q>. They are used in various applications, including implementing other data structures like stacks and queues, dynamic memory allocation, and representing lists where the size is not known beforehand.

        <h3>
            ...This Paragraph is About Queue...
        </h3>
        A queue is a <b>linear data structure</b> that follows the <i>First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle</i>, much like a line of people waiting – the first person in line is the first one to be served. It supports two primary operations: enqueue, which adds an element to the rear (end) of the queue, and dequeue, which removes and returns the element from the front (beginning) of the queue. Common operations also include peek or front to view the element at the front without removing it, and isEmpty to check if the queue is empty. <q>Queues are fundamental in managing tasks in operating systems (like print queues), handling requests in servers, and implementing breadth-first search in graph algorithms</q>. Their FIFO nature ensures fair processing of elements in the order they arrive.

        <h2>
            ...This Paragraph Is About Array...
        </h2>
        An array is a fundamental, <b>linear data structure</b> that stores a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type in <b>contiguous memory locations</b>. <i>Each element in an array can be accessed directly using its index (position), typically starting from zero</i>. This direct access provides constant-time complexity for retrieving any element, making arrays highly efficient for accessing data when the index is known. However, the fixed size can be a limitation, as adding or removing elements in the middle of an array can be inefficient due to the need to shift subsequent elements. Arrays are widely used for storing lists of data where the size is known and frequent random access is required, forming the basis for many other data structures and algorithms.

        <h2>
            ...This Paragraph Is About Tree And Graph...
        </h2>

        A tree is a <b>hierarchical data structure</b> that consists of <i>nodes connected by edges</i>. It has a root node at the top, and each node can have zero or more child nodes, forming a parent-child relationship. Unlike linear data structures, trees have a branching structure and do not contain cycles. Key concepts in trees include the root, parent, child, leaf (a node with no children), and subtree (a tree formed by a node and its descendants). Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as file systems, organizational structures, and decision trees. Specific types of trees, like binary search trees, offer efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations, making them crucial for implementing data storage and retrieval systems.   
        <br>
        A graph is a <b>non-linear data structure</b> consisting of a set of vertices (or nodes) connected by edges. Unlike trees, graphs can have cycles, and there is no inherent root node or hierarchical structure. Edges can be directed (pointing from one vertex to another) or undirected (representing a bidirectional connection). Graphs are powerful for modeling relationships and networks, such as social networks, transportation systems, and the internet. They are used in various algorithms for tasks like finding shortest paths, network analysis, and mapping dependencies. The flexibility of graphs allows them to represent complex and interconnected systems.
