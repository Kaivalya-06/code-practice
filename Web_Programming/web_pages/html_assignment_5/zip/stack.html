        A stack is a <b>fundamental and Linear data structure</b> in computer science that operates on the <i>Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle</i>, akin to a stack of plates where the last plate placed on top is the first one to be removed. It supports two primary operations: push, which adds an element to the top of the stack, and pop, which removes and returns the topmost element. Additionally, a peek or top operation allows inspection of the top element without removing it, and an isEmpty operation checks if the stack contains any elements.
        Stacks find widespread applications in various computing tasks. They are essential for managing function calls in program execution, keeping track of return addresses, and handling local variables. Compilers utilize stacks for parsing expressions and translating code. In web browsers, the back button functionality often relies on a stack to store the history of visited pages. Undo/redo features in many applications are also implemented using stacks. Their inherent simplicity and efficiency for LIFO operations make them a valuable tool in algorithm design and system implementation. The constrained access (only from the top) ensures a predictable and organized way of managing data in specific scenarios.
