        <h2>...This Paragraph Is About Linked List...</h2>
        <br>
        A linked list is a <b>linear data structure</b> where <i>elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element, called a node, contains the data itself and a pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence</i>. This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position, as it only requires updating the pointers of the neighboring nodes, unlike arrays where shifting elements can be time-consuming. <q>Linked lists can be singly linked (pointing only to the next node) or doubly linked (where each node also points to the previous node), offering flexibility in traversal</q>. They are used in various applications, including implementing other data structures like stacks and queues, dynamic memory allocation, and representing lists where the size is not known beforehand.
